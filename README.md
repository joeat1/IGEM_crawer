    Landing sites are required before page modifications, file uploads, or access to information is required.During the login process, the service will perform three page jumps.
    The login function has been implemented in the function `loginpage` in the igem_upload.py, you should set your own username and password for it.

    To modify the content of the webpage, you need to log in first. Then you can set a new webpage code or refresh the original content.It should be noted that the web page is generated after compilation.

    The edit function has been implemented in the function `editpage` in the igem_upload.py.
